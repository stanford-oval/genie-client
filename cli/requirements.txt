# These are the **dev** requirements, and do _not_ include the cli package
# itself because it triggers the Docker build to re-do layers all the time.
# 
# So, for a full-setup (from the repo root):
# 
#     pip install -r ./cli/requirements.txt
#     pip install -e ./cli
# 

# Building and publishing
# setuptools
# wheel
# twine

# VSCode / formatting stuff
